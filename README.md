# Elastic Stack Test Environment #

Just use `vagrant up --provision` and you will have a complete Elastic Stack testing environment

This is an early version of the test setup and needs more work. For example this uses just a single host and does not provide an Elasticsearch cluster.

Most of the vagrant and puppet magic was inspired by the [Icinga 2 Vagrant boxes](https://github.com/lbetz/vagrant-icinga-book)
